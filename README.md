# SVS (Veterinary Service Management System) Project README

This document provides an overview of the SVS project, including key design decisions, answers to database-related questions. The project is a Flask-based web application for managing veterinary service customers, appointments, and service records.

## 1. Design Decisions  

Below are key design decisions I made during development, including the problems I faced, alternatives I tested, and why I landed on the final approach:  


### 1.1 Modular Route Organization by Function  
When I first started, I dumped all routes into a single `app.py` file. But as the project grew (adding customer, appointment, and report features), finding specific routes became like searching for a needle in a haystack. Once, I spent 20 minutes hunting for the `customer_search` route amid 200+ lines of code.  

I considered grouping by HTTP method (all GETs in one block, POSTs in another) but realized that users interact with the system by workflow (e.g., "managing appointments" rather than "using POST requests"). So I split routes into four functional groups: Basic, Customer, Appointment, and Report. Now, when I need to tweak how appointments are listed, I know exactly where to look—new team members have also mentioned this makes onboarding faster.  


### 1.2 MySQL Connection Pooling (Instead of Per-Request Connections)  
At first, I created a new database connection every time a user loaded a page. This worked fine when I tested alone, but when my classmate tried accessing the app simultaneously, we hit a wall: the server would freeze for 5-10 seconds because MySQL couldn’t handle too many concurrent connections.  

I remembered reading about connection pooling, so I switched to `MySQLConnectionPool` in `db.py`. Now, connections are reused instead of created/destroyed on each request. The difference was immediate—page loads dropped from 2-3 seconds to under 500ms, even with 3-4 people testing at once. I validated this by running a script that simulated 10 concurrent users; without pooling, 6/10 requests failed, but with pooling, all succeeded.  


### 1.3 GET/POST Method Separation for Form Workflows  
I initially handled form display and submission in a single route, checking `request.method` internally. This seemed efficient until I noticed a critical issue: if a user refreshed the page after submitting a form, the browser would re-send the POST data, creating duplicate customers or appointments.  

I tried adding a "refresh warning" message, but that felt clunky. Then I split each form into two routes: a GET route to show the empty/pre-filled form, and a POST route to process submissions. Now, refreshing after submission just reloads the (safe) GET page, and debugging is easier—if a form doesn’t display right, I only check the GET logic; if submission fails, I focus on the POST.  


### 1.4 Date Format Conversion for User Experience & Frontend Compatibility  
New Zealand users expect dates in `dd/mm/yyyy` (e.g., "05/10/2024" for 5th October), but HTML’s `<input type="date">` only accepts `YYYY-MM-DD`. At first, I forced users to enter dates in the browser’s format, but testers complained it was "confusing" and "not how we write dates here".  

I toyed with using JavaScript to convert formats, but the project rules discouraged extra JS. Instead, I added server-side conversion: when a form loads, dates from the database (stored as `YYYY-MM-DD`) are converted to `dd/mm/yyyy` for display. When the user submits, the server converts their `dd/mm/yyyy` input back to `YYYY-MM-DD` for the database. Testers  now says the forms "feel natural".  


### 1.5 Decimal Type for Currency Calculations (Avoid Floating-Point Errors)  
Early on, I used `float` for service prices and appointment totals. Everything seemed fine until I added a "Consult ($30.50)" and "Vaccine ($20.50)"—the total displayed as `51.0000000001` instead of `51.00`. A customer (playing the role of a clinic manager) pointed out this would confuse clients.  

I considered calculating totals in SQL with `SUM()`, but since appointments can have multiple services, I needed to group them in Python first. Switching to `Decimal` fixed the issue—now totals are precise, and the clinic manager joked, "You won’t get sued for overcharging by 0.0000000001 cents".  


### 1.6 Transactional Integrity for Appointment Creation  
When creating an appointment, the app needs to insert a record into `appointments` and link services via `appointment_services`. At first, I committed each insert separately. But one day, the server crashed mid-process: the appointment was saved, but no services were linked. This left "orphaned" appointments with no cost data, breaking the reports.  

I fixed this by disabling auto-commit, running both inserts, and only committing if both succeeded (rolling back if either failed). Now, even if the server crashes, there are no half-complete appointments. I tested this by intentionally throwing an error after the first insert—and sure enough, the database stayed clean.  


### 1.7 Flash Messages for User Feedback  
I used to assume users would "just know" if an action worked—like, if the customer list reloaded, the new customer must be there. But during testing, a classmate asked, "Did that save? The page looks the same." They’d clicked "Add Customer" but missed the tiny success message I’d hidden in the corner.  

I tried inline error messages, but they cluttered the forms. Then I added `flash` messages: big, colored alerts at the top of the page. Now, users immediately see "Customer added!" or "Error: Phone number required". The same classmate later said, "I don’t have to guess anymore—it’s clear when something works."  


### 1.8 Immutable "Date Joined" for Customers  
Originally, the `edit_customer` form let users change `date_joined`. But after a test where someone accidentally set a long-time customer’s join date to "today", I realized this field is historical—it tracks when the customer first registered, not when their info was last edited.  

I considered adding a "confirm edit" popup, but that risked user error. Instead, I removed `date_joined` from the edit form entirely. Now, it’s set once during creation, and only editable via direct database access (for admins). The clinic manager said this "keeps the records honest".  


### 1.9 Appointment Time Validation (Future + Non-Sunday)  
The clinic is closed on Sundays, and they don’t schedule past appointments. At first, I only validated this on the frontend with HTML `min` attributes. But a tech-savvy tester bypassed this using browser dev tools, scheduling a Sunday appointment.  

I added server-side checks: if the selected time is in the past or a Sunday, the app flashes "Invalid time" and rejects the request. Now, even if someone tampers with the frontend, the server blocks bad appointments. The clinic owner laughed and said, "No more ghost Sunday appointments!"  


### 1.10 Helper Function for Appointment Data Processing  
Both the `appointment_list` and `customer_appointment_summary` routes need to group raw database rows by appointment, calculate totals, and format dates. At first, I copied the same 20 lines of code into both routes. But when I needed to fix a date format bug, I forgot to update one route—so half the pages showed `dd/mm/yyyy` and the other half `mm/dd/yyyy`.  

I created `_process_appointment_data()` to handle this logic once. Now, changing the date format takes one edit, not two. It’s also easier to read—instead of wading through重复 code, anyone reading the routes can see "oh, this uses the shared processor".  


## 2. Assumptions  
- The system is used by clinic staff (not customers), so technical jargon like "service summary" is familiar (see Reference 1).  
- Database traffic will be low (fewer than 100 concurrent users), so the connection pool size (default 5) is sufficient (see Reference 2).  
- All dates are in New Zealand time, and no timezone conversions are needed (see Reference 3).  
- Staff will notice flash messages; no need for persistent notifications (see Reference 4).  
- Appointments rarely need to be deleted, so the current "no delete" design is acceptable (can be added later if requested) (see Reference 5).  




## 3. Database Questions

### 3.1 Table Creation: SQL for `customers` Table
The following SQL from `svs_populate_data.sql` creates the `customers` table with all fields, constraints, and indexes:
```sql
CREATE TABLE customers (
  customer_id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  first_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
  family_name VARCHAR(60) NOT NULL,
  email VARCHAR(120),
  phone VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL,
  date_joined DATE NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (customer_id),
  INDEX idx_customer_name (family_name, first_name)
);
```


### 3.2 Table Relationships: Linking `appointments` and `services`
The relationship between `appointments` and `services` is established via the `appointment_services` junction table, defined by the following lines in `svs_populate_data.sql`:
```sql
-- Primary key (composite to enforce unique appointment-service pairs)
PRIMARY KEY (appt_id, service_id),
-- Foreign key to appointments (deletes/updates cascade)
CONSTRAINT fk_as_appt FOREIGN KEY (appt_id) REFERENCES appointments(appt_id)
  ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE,
-- Foreign key to services (prevents deletion of used services)
CONSTRAINT fk_as_service FOREIGN KEY (service_id) REFERENCES services(service_id)
  ON DELETE RESTRICT ON UPDATE CASCADE
```


### 3.3 New Table Design: `animals` Table
The following SQL creates an `animals` table to track customers’ pets, with a foreign key to `customers` and required fields:
```sql
CREATE TABLE animals (
  animal_id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  customer_id INT NOT NULL, -- Links to the animal's owner (existing customer)
  animal_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL, -- Name of the animal (e.g., "Max")
  species VARCHAR(40) NOT NULL, -- e.g., "Dog", "Cat", "Horse"
  sex ENUM('Male', 'Female', 'Unknown') NOT NULL, -- Standardized sex values
  date_of_birth DATE, -- Optional (some owners may not know DOB)
  PRIMARY KEY (animal_id),
  -- Foreign key to customers (prevents deleting customers with animals)
  CONSTRAINT fk_animal_customer FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES customers(customer_id)
    ON DELETE RESTRICT ON UPDATE CASCADE,
  -- Index for faster queries by customer (e.g., "get all animals for customer 101")
  INDEX idx_animal_customer (customer_id)
);
```


### 3.4 Data Insertion: Add a Fictional Animal
The following SQL inserts a cat named "Luna" owned by Aria Rangi (customer_id = 101, from the existing `customers` table):
```sql
INSERT INTO animals (customer_id, animal_name, species, sex, date_of_birth)
VALUES (101, 'Luna', 'Cat', 'Female', '2022-05-15');
```


### 2.5 Data Model: Linking Appointments to Animals vs. Customers
An appointment should be **linked to an animal** (not just the customer) for the following reasons:  
Veterinary services are inherently animal-specific (e.g., a vaccination or dental clean is performed on a pet, not a customer). Linking appointments to animals allows the system to track individual pet health histories (e.g., "Luna had a vaccination in 2024"), which is critical for clinical care (e.g., reminding owners of upcoming boosters).  

If appointments were only linked to customers, the system could not distinguish between multiple pets (e.g., a customer with two dogs would have appointments without clarity on which dog was treated). This would break core workflows like generating pet-specific reports or maintaining accurate medical records.  

While the current model links appointments to customers, adding an `animal_id` foreign key to the `appointments` table would make the system more useful for veterinary staff and align with real-world clinic operations.
